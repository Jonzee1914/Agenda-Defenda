# Agenda Defenda
Your daily agenda is critical to your professional success - SO DEFEND IT!

## Purpose

## Features Include:
* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* Time blocks for standard business hours (including 8am because this is America and capitalists start the day early) 
* Time blocks that are color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past
* The ability to enter an event, and save it to local storage, and persist after refresh
* The ability to clear your agenda when you decide to cancel everything and go enjoy your day (wasn't required but thought it was nice)

## Built With:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

## Utilizes:
* jQuery
* Moment.js (due to time constraints, was unable to find and learn a new API)
